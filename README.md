# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles!

Right now this repository only contains:
* bashrc
* vimrc

To use these dotfiles:
1. Clone the repository into your home directory
2. `cd ~/dotfiles`
3. `sh makesymlinks.sh` to backup your old dotfiles into `~/dotfiles_old` and create symlinks for the dotfiles contained in this repo!
